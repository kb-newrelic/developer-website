Our Memcached [integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Memcached instance to our platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. We collect data at both instance and slab levels.

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect.

## Compatibility and requirements [#comp-req]

Our integration is compatible with Memcached 1.4 or higher.

If Memcached is **not** running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic) on a host that's running Memcached. Otherwise:

* If running on Kubernetes, see [these requirements](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes#requirements).
* If running on ECS, see [these requirements](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).

## Quick start [#quick]

Instrument your Memcached instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent.

Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Memcached integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument.

The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL instance.

## Install and activate [#install]

To install the Memcached integration, follow the instructions for your environment:

<CollapserGroup>

    1. Install [the infrastructure agent](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-infrastructure-host-integrations/#install), and replace the `INTEGRATION_FILE_NAME` variable with `nri-memcached`.
    2. Change directory to the integrations folder:

       ```
       cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
       ```
    3. Copy the sample configuration file:

       ```
       sudo cp memcached-config.yml.sample memcached-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `memcached-config.yml` file as described in the [configuration settings](#config).

    1. Download the `nri-memcached` .MSI installer image from:

       [https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-memcached/nri-memcached-amd64.msi](https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-memcached/nri-memcached-amd64.msi)
    2. To install from the Windows command prompt, run:

       ```
       msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\TO\nri-memcached-amd64.msi
       ```
    3. In the Integrations directory, `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running:

       ```
       cp memcached-config.yml.sample memcached-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `memcached-config.yml` configuration file using the [configuration settings](#config).

Additional notes:

* <DoNotTranslate>**Advanced:**</DoNotTranslate> Integrations are also available in [tarball format](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-host-integrations-built-new-relic#tarball) to allow for install outside of a package manager.
* <DoNotTranslate>**On-host integrations do not automatically update.**</DoNotTranslate> For best results, regularly [update the integration package](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/update-infrastructure-host-integration-package) and [the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

## Configure the integration [#config]

An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference.

There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed:

* If enabled via Kubernetes: see [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
* If enabled via Amazon ECS: see [Monitor services running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
* If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, `memcached-config.yml`.

The configuration file has common settings used by all of our integrations, such as `interval`, `timeout`, and `inventory_source`. For more on these common settings, see our [configuration properties list](/docs/create-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-newer-configuration-format/#options-list).

If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, see the [standard configuration format](/docs/create-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-standard-configuration-format/) for help.

Specific settings related to Memcached are defined using the `env` section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Memcached instance as well as other security settings and features.

Configuration options are below. For a better sense of how this works in practice, see our [example config file](#example-config).

## Memcached instance settings [#instance-settings]

The Memcached integration collects both Metrics(<strong>M</strong>) and Inventory(<strong>I</strong>) information. Check the <DoNotTranslate>**Applies To**</DoNotTranslate> column to find which settings can be used for each collection:


The values for these settings can be defined in several ways:

* Add the value directly in the config file.
* Replace the values from environment variables using the `{{}}` notation. This requires infrastructure agent version 1.14.0 or higher. Read more [here](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent/#passthrough) or see example [below](#example4).
* Use secrets management to protect sensitive information, such as passwords, from being exposed in plain text in the configuration file. For more information, see how to use [secrets management](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).

## Labels/custom attributes [#labels]

You can also decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics. You can use them to query, filter, or group your metrics.

Our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, but you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice.

```
 labels:
   env: production
   role: memcached
```

### Example configuration [#example-config]

Example `memcached-config.yml` file configuration:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="example"
    title="Example configuration"
  >
    ```
    integrations:
      - name: nri-memcached
        env:
          PORT: "11211"
          HOST: memcached_host

          # ifauthentication is enabled.
          USERNAME: cacheuser
          PASSWORD: password
        interval: 15s
        inventory_source: config/memcached
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see [our integration configuration overview](/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/host-integration-configuration-overview).

## Find and use data [#find-and-use]

Data from this service is reported to an [integration dashboard](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/infrastructure-integration-dashboards-charts).

Metrics are attached to these [event types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic):

* `MemcachedSample`
* `MemcachedSlabSample`

You can [query this data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

For more on how to find and use your data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

The Memcached integration collects the following metric data attributes.

### Memcached sample metrics [#memcached-sample]

These attributes are attached to this `MemcachedSample` event type:


### Memcached slab sample metrics [#memcached-slab-sample]
